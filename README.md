# UDP Programming Languages 
This is a page where I am going to store, every exercise I have in my college programming courses

## C++
Here I start with fundamentals of c++

First class (1.x)
Here I learn to understand variable types, operators, and how to use them, including some basic exercises.

Second class (2.x)
Here I learn how to use see cin, cout, and variables, where we start developing little programs to strengthen our logical thinking.

Third class (3.x)
This class were just exercises 

Fourth class (4.x)
Here we learn flow control, and how to use if, else and else if.

Fifth class (5.x)
Here we try to go deep in c++ and do more exercises.
